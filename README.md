Ayman Naji(an443), Joshua Fraser(jdf254), Laura Gonzalez (lg458), Simon Chen (sc2284)


The goal of our project is to analyze fatal police shooting data and identify whether demographics and location affect the number of shootings. We plan on answering the following questions: 

  1. How does an individual's demographics affect their chances of being shot by the police?  
  2. How has the frequency of police shootings changed in the last 5 years (2015-2020)? Are there certain times of the year/location where they occur at higher rates?
